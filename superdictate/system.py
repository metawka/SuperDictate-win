    working: the AttributeError was caught, logged and swallowed.

    The result is obtained through ``QueryInterface`` rather than
    ``ctypes.cast``. Casting builds a second Python object over the same

    together release one reference twice; the object is freed while the

    killed task, a power loss — leaves the machine silent, with nothing on
    screen to connect the silence to this app.

    So the mute is guarded twice. ``atexit`` covers an orderly exit and an
    unhandled exception, and a marker file on disk covers everything else:

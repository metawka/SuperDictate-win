"""Filesystem layout for the Windows port.

The macOS build keeps everything under ``~/Library/Application Support/
SuperDictate`` with the FluidAudio model cache in a sibling directory.
(The app was called SuperDictate here too, before 1.5.0.)
Windows has no equivalent split, so one ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Dictation`` tree
holds settings, history and the ONNX model cache. Keeping the model inside
the same tree means an uninstall that spares user data also spares the
~600 MB download, matching the macOS uninstall.sh behaviour.

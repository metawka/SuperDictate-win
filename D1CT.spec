"""PyInstaller build for D1CT.

One-folder rather than one-file: onnxruntime ships large native DLLs, and
a one-file build would unpack ~200 MB to a temporary directory on every
launch, adding seconds to a hotkey-driven app that is meant to sit in the
tray from login.

The speech model is NOT bundled. It is ~640 MB, it is licensed
separately, and the app already downloads it on first run with a progress
bar into %LOCALAPPDATA%\\D1CT\\Models.
